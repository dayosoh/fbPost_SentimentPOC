Before the marriage, I forced my husband to buy a medical card and even had a fight about it. My husband felt that it was not necessary.
But I never expected that I would spend 500,000 in medical expenses.

[Is it necessary to buy a medical card]
Some people think government hospitals are good
Some people think that private hospitals are better
I think government/private are both good
But if you have a medical card in hand
It means giving one more choice in life
So I think medical card is necessary
Let’s use my husband’s case as a case study
We sent him to the local government hospital
Because there are only government hospitals there
My husband suffered severe trauma and multiple fractures.
The orthopedics department over there won't do this surgery.
at first they said
I might send my husband to Kuantan Hospital
Later, he said that he would send a doctor over.
It turned out that I met the Malay New Year
It will take two weeks before surgery can be done
How can you wait two weeks for such a serious injury?
I said I want to transfer to a private hospital
The doctor also asked me if I have a medical card
Please transfer immediately
Otherwise, my husband may be disabled for life
I'm not sure I can ask for it.
They immediately transferred to the government hospital
I'm not sure about going to a big hospital either.
Will they start treatment right away?
I don’t dare to blog and I can’t blog
Because he was in too much pain at the time
Our medical card is
I forced him to buy it before we got married.
We even had a quarrel at that time
Because my husband doesn’t think it’s necessary
Why do you have to spend this money every month?
I said this is for you and me to protect our family.
He also said that if you don’t buy insurance, you won’t get married.
Haha, it’s funny even thinking about it
Some people use marriage to force their husbands to buy insurance
Finally he compromised and I arranged everything
The premium of his medical card is RM244 per month
Annual insured amount RM1mil+-
The ward is guaranteed at RM150/night
(Never claimed, 10% added every year)
So now he can stay in a ward with a price below RM240
Living allowance of RM150 for each day of hospitalization
This insurance lasts for 6 years once you buy it.
never used
RM244*6 years*12 months=RM17,568
The cost for my husband’s accidental hospital admission was RM503,604.69.
This does not include subsequent replacement of the stoma.
and the cost of removing the screws.
I paid more than 10,000 yuan in insurance premiums but spent 500,000 yuan on it.
Does everyone have the same idea as
When I bought it, I thought it was very expensive.
But when I need it, I seem to buy less.
[The Importance of Insurance Brokers]
Each person/family’s burden is different
Everyone needs to find the right insurance broker
Discuss and plan your insurance needs together
What is the right insurance broker?
The one who is there when you are in need
Able to give you a definite answer in a timely manner/
someone who guides you
Since we have never had this kind of hospitalization experience
My insurance agent at the time
I asked him a lot of questions
There are some things he can't give me a definite answer to.
Or the answer is a little vague and I'm confused
I stopped thinking about it after that.
Because as long as the annual insurance amount is enough to treat my husband
Cost of other small details
I'll think of a solution then
**Because all the money is used to start a business, the economy is really tight.
Maybe it's God's mercy
A netizen sent a private message saying that something big happened to her mother too.
She also stayed in the hospital for a while
Let me find her whenever I need her
Then she casually said that she had been working in the insurance industry for ten years
At that time, I just politely replied to her thank you.
Until my husband's condition stabilized slightly
I thought of her and took the initiative to contact her
She happens to be an insurance broker from AIA
I was really impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge afterward.
So our family’s insurance
All hands were turned away from her
That's the insurance broker
When you really need insurance
She is the person who can give you "a sense of security"
Insurance companies each have their own merits
than the company
I think insurance brokers are more important
Just like when my husband was discharged from the hospital
Because too many doctors are involved
We can't leave the hospital even if we wait until 4pm.
Eventually my agent kept calling the front desk
🧑🏻‍⚕️: The follow-up date and medicine are ready. All that remains is to contact the insurance company. If they want to return first, just put down a RM500 deposit.
👩🏼: This patient will come back for follow-up consultation on 20/6, so you don’t have to worry about him running away. They live far away and driving late is dangerous. Besides, his medical expenses are RM500k+, so it doesn’t make sense for you to charge RM500, right?
Last 4:30pm
The person at the counter comes into the ward
Sign a letter for me as usual
No deposit required
We left immediately
Summarize:
Health is very important
When there is a health problem
Medical card is very important
When you have questions about your medical card
Insurance brokers are important
